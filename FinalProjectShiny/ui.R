      The ngrams with frequency 1 were omitted in order to fit the array in 1GB limits.
      The data is stored as a list of data.table objects, containing the following columns: 
      2-gram first word for input; 2-gram second word for prediction; ... 7-gram first 6-gram for input; 7-gram last word for prediction.  
      The data.table objects contains from 186K rows for 1-grams to 2.5M rows for 3-grams 
      and takes 735 MB of memory. In the absence of information for the prediction the code propose a word THE, as the most common one.
